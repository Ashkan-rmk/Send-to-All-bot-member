# Send to All bot member

A simple android application that uses java telegram API to send bulk messages to your bot members at once.

## Important Tip

You can configure delay for sending each message depending on your member's count, because right now telegram doesnt support bulk messaging and has some limitation.

## How to use

You have to just replace your BOT-TOKEN in this directory: `/app/src/main/java/com/example/smn/paypingbotbroadcast/ScrollingActivity.java` and set your POST/GET method to get your telegram bot member Ids.

Build... Done!
